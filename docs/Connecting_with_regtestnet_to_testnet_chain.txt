STEP 4 — BITCOIN TESTNET VALIDATION (ON-CHAIN CONNECTIVITY)

Overview

This step validates that the mining pool is connected to the REAL Bitcoin Testnet and is participating in public, on-chain Bitcoin activity. Unlike regtest, Bitcoin Testnet is a globally shared network with real peers, blocks, and transactions that are visible on public explorers.

Successfully completing this step proves that the pool architecture is not theoretical or local-only, but fully capable of operating on a real Bitcoin network.

Why This Step Matters

Bitcoin Regtest:

Fully local

Deterministic

Invisible to the outside world

Ideal for development and testing

Bitcoin Testnet:

Public peer-to-peer network

Real consensus rules

Blocks and transactions visible globally

Demonstrates real on-chain behavior

Connecting to Testnet proves that:

The pool can communicate with real Bitcoin nodes

Block data and headers are synchronized from the network

The architecture works beyond a simulated environment

Step 4 Objectives

The goal of Step 4 is to confirm:

Bitcoin Core is running in TESTNET mode

The node is using the correct testnet data directory

The node is connected to real public peers

Live blockchain data is being exchanged

On-chain activity is observable and verifiable

Testnet Configuration Validation

Bitcoin Core was started explicitly in testnet mode:

bitcoind -testnet -daemon

Verification command:

bitcoin-cli -testnet getblockchaininfo

Expected result:

"chain": "test"

This confirms the node is running on Bitcoin Testnet and not regtest or mainnet.

Testnet Data Directory Verification

Bitcoin Core maintains separate directories for each network.

For testnet, the active directory is:

~/.bitcoin/testnet3/

The presence of the following confirms correct setup:

blocks/

chainstate/

debug.log

wallets/

This ensures:

No overlap with regtest data

Independent blockchain state

Clean separation of environments

Live Network Connectivity (Key Validation)

The most important confirmation is real peer connectivity.

Live logs were monitored using:

tail -f ~/.bitcoin/testnet3/debug.log

Observed indicators of real network participation:

Outbound and inbound peer connections

Header synchronization messages

UpdateTip events

Remote peer IP addresses

Continuous blockchain activity

These logs demonstrate that the node is actively communicating with the public Bitcoin Testnet.

Peer Count Verification

Network connectivity was quantitatively verified using:

bitcoin-cli -testnet getpeerinfo | wc -l

A peer count greater than zero confirms:

Successful peer discovery

Active participation in the testnet P2P network

Readiness for mining and block submission

On-Chain Visibility Confirmation

Because this is Bitcoin Testnet:

Blocks mined by this node will be broadcast to public peers

Transactions and blocks can be viewed on public explorers such as:

mempool.space/testnet

blockstream.info/testnet

This enables judges and reviewers to independently verify:

Block hashes

Coinbase transactions

Mining addresses

Network acceptance

Outcome of Step 4

After completing Step 4, the system has achieved:

Real Bitcoin Testnet connectivity

Public, on-chain participation

Observable blockchain synchronization

Verified readiness for real testnet mining

This step bridges the gap between local simulation (regtest) and real blockchain infrastructure.

Why This Is Important for the Project

Completing Step 4 proves that:

The mining pool architecture is production-realistic

The system is not limited to local testing

The same codebase can operate on real networks

On-chain behavior is verifiable and transparent

This validation strengthens the credibility of the project and demonstrates real-world applicability.

Next Steps

After Step 4, the system is ready for:

Testnet wallet creation

Real testnet mining

Block reward attribution

Public on-chain demonstrations

Integration with real miners
